# O-MI-Mist-Tunnel
Tunnels O-MI messages via Mist/Wish identity overlay network.

This js library can be used on both "client" and "server" side. "server" side is implemented by a web socket connection to O-MI Node (usually on localhost). "client" side means here that the library is used from a nodejs application to make O-MI requests.

## Server
See `run.js`

## Client
See `client.js`
